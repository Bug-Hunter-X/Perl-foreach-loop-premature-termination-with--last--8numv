This repository demonstrates a common issue in Perl's foreach loop when using the 'last' statement. The provided code snippet shows how the loop unexpectedly stops before iterating through all elements, and the solution illustrates how to properly handle this scenario to achieve the desired output.  The solution offers several approaches to handle conditional loop termination correctly, preventing unintended behavior.
